### Lemma 1.3: Lipschitz Continuity of the Projection Operator
<div class="thesis-element">

**Lemma 1.3:** Let the ambient space be $\mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ and the domain be the Stiefel manifold $V(n, k)$. The projection operator $P_X: \mathbb{R}^{n \times k} \to T_X V(n, k)$, defined for a fixed $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ as a function of $X$,
$$P_X(Z) = Z - \frac{1}{2}(XZ^\top X + XX^\top Z)$$
is a smooth ($C^\infty$) function of $X$. Consequently, $P_X(Z)$ is globally Lipschitz continuous in $X$ on the compact manifold $V(n, k)$.

**Proof:**

1.  **Analyze the Function's Components:** We analyze the differentiability of the map $\Phi: V(n, k) \to \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ given by $\Phi(X) = P_X(Z)$ for a fixed matrix $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$.

2.  **Identify Basic Operations:** The function $\Phi(X)$ is constructed from the variable $X$ and constants ($Z$, $Z^\top$, $\frac{1}{2}$) using only matrix multiplication and addition.
    * The map $X \mapsto X$ is the identity map, which is $C^\infty$.
    * The map $X \mapsto X^\top$ is the transpose operation, which is linear and thus $C^\infty$.
    * Matrix multiplication $(A, B) \mapsto AB$ is a bilinear operation. Each entry of the resulting matrix is a polynomial in the entries of $A$ and $B$. It is a $C^\infty$ operation.

3.  **Analyze the Terms:**
    * **Term 1:** $Z$ is constant with respect to $X$.
    * **Term 2:** $T_2(X) = XZ^\top X$. This is a composition of $C^\infty$ maps (identity, transpose, and multiplication). Therefore, $T_2(X)$ is $C^\infty$.
    * **Term 3:** $T_3(X) = XX^\top Z$. This is also a composition of $C^\infty$ maps (identity, transpose, and multiplication). Therefore, $T_3(X)$ is $C^\infty$.

4.  **Analyze the Full Operator:** The operator $\Phi(X)$ is a linear combination of $C^\infty$ terms:
    $$\Phi(X) = Z - \frac{1}{2}T_2(X) - \frac{1}{2}T_3(X)$$
    A finite linear combination of $C^\infty$ functions is itself $C^\infty$. Therefore, $P_X(Z)$ is a smooth ($C^\infty$) function of $X$.

5.  **Smoothness Implies Lipschitz Continuity on Compact Sets:**
    * Any $C^\infty$ function is, by definition, $C^1$.
    * As established in Lemma 1.1, any $C^1$ function on the compact manifold $V(n, k)$ has a bounded derivative.
    * A bounded derivative implies global Lipschitz continuity on that domain.
