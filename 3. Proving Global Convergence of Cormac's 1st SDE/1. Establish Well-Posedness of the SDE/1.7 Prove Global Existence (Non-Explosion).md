### Lemma 1.7: Global Existence of the Unique Solution
<div class="thesis-element">

**Lemma 1.7:** The unique local strong solution $\mathbf{X}_t$ to the $N$-particle SDE system, guaranteed by Lemma 1.6, is a unique **global** strong solution (i.e., it does not explode in finite time, almost surely).

---

**Proof:**

1.  **Local Solution and Explosion Time:** From **Lemma 1.6**, we have a unique strong solution $\mathbf{X}_t$ defined on the time interval $[0, \tau_e)$, where $\tau_e$ is the (possibly finite) explosion time.

2.  **Invariance of the Manifold:** From **Lemma 1.5**, we proved that the Itô correction term ensures that if a particle $X_t^i$ starts on the manifold $V(n, k)$, it remains on the manifold for all $t \in [0, \tau_e)$.
    * Given an initial condition $\mathbf{X}_0 \in \mathcal{X} = (V(n, k))^N$, the solution $\mathbf{X}_t$ remains in $\mathcal{X}$ for its entire lifespan $[0, \tau_e)$.

3.  **Compactness of the State Space:** The Stiefel manifold $V(n, k) = \{X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k} | X^\top X = I_k\}$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$. By the Heine-Borel theorem, $V(n, k)$ is compact.
    * The full $N$-particle state space $\mathcal{X} = (V(n, k))^N$ is a finite product of compact sets. By Tychonoff's theorem, $\mathcal{X}$ is also a compact set.

4.  **Non-Explosion on Compact Sets:** An explosion in finite time means that $\lim_{t \to \tau_e} ||\mathbf{X}_t|| = \infty$.
    * However, as established in step 2, the solution $\mathbf{X}_t$ is confined to the compact set $\mathcal{X}$ for all $t \in [0, \tau_e)$.
    * By definition, any set of points within a compact set is bounded. Therefore, $||\mathbf{X}_t|| \le M$ for some finite constant $M$ for all $t < \tau_e$.
    * This creates a contradiction: the norm of the solution is bounded, so it cannot diverge to infinity.

5.  **Conclusion:** The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the explosion time is not finite. Therefore, $\tau_e = \infty$ almost surely. The local solution (from Prop 1.6) can be extended to all $t \ge 0$, making it a unique global strong solution.
