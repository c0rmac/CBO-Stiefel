### Lemma 1.2: Lipschitz Continuity of the Consensus Point
<div class="thesis-element">

**Lemma 1.2:** Let the state space of the $N$-particle system be $\mathcal{X} = (V(n, k))^N$, which is a compact manifold. The consensus point $\overline{X}_t^*$ is a function $C: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ defined as:
$$C(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^N X^j \exp(-\beta f(X^j))}{\sum_{l=1}^N \exp(-\beta f(X^l))}$$
where $\mathbf{X} = (X^1, \dots, X^N) \in \mathcal{X}$.

If the objective function $f: V(n, k) \to \mathbb{R}$ is $C^1$, then the consensus function $C(\mathbf{X})$ is Lipschitz continuous with respect to a product metric on $\mathcal{X}$.

**Proof:**

This proof follows the same principle as Lemma 1.1: a $C^1$ function on a compact domain is Lipschitz continuous.

1.  **Domain Compactness:** The state space $\mathcal{X} = (V(n, k))^N$ is a finite product of compact manifolds. Therefore, $\mathcal{X}$ is itself a compact manifold.

2.  **Differentiability of Components:**
    * From Lemma 1.1, we assume $f$ is $C^1$.
    * The exponential function $\exp: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is $C^\infty$ (smooth).
    * The $j$-th projection $\pi_j: \mathcal{X} \to V(n, k)$ mapping $\mathbf{X} \mapsto X^j$ is $C^\infty$.
    * Therefore, the weight function $w_j(\mathbf{X}) = \exp(-\beta f(\pi_j(\mathbf{X})))$ is a composition of $C^1$ functions, and is itself $C^1$.

3.  **Differentiability of Numerator and Denominator:**
    * Let $W(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{l=1}^N w_l(\mathbf{X})$ be the denominator. As a finite sum of $C^1$ functions, $W(\mathbf{X})$ is $C^1$.
    * Let $N(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{j=1}^N \pi_j(\mathbf{X}) \cdot w_j(\mathbf{X})$ be the numerator. This is a sum of products of $C^1$ functions (the matrix-valued projection $\pi_j$ and the scalar-valued weight $w_j$). Therefore, $N(\mathbf{X})$ is also $C^1$.

4.  **Denominator is Bounded Away from Zero:**
    * Since $f$ is continuous on the compact set $V(n, k)$, it attains a global maximum, $f_{\max} = \sup_X f(X) < \infty$.
    * The denominator $W(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{l=1}^N \exp(-\beta f(X^l))$ is bounded below by a strictly positive constant:
        $$W(\mathbf{X}) \ge \sum_{l=1}^N \exp(-\beta f_{\max}) = N \exp(-\beta f_{\max}) > 0$$

5.  **Differentiability of the Quotient:**
    * The consensus function $C(\mathbf{X}) = N(\mathbf{X}) / W(\mathbf{X})$ is the quotient of two $C^1$ functions where the denominator is non-zero.
    * By the quotient rule for differentiation, $C(\mathbf{X})$ is a $C^1$ function from the manifold $\mathcal{X}$ to the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$.

6.  **Bounded Derivative Implies Lipschitz Continuity:**
    * Since $C(\mathbf{X})$ is $C^1$ and its domain $\mathcal{X}$ is compact, its derivative (the Jacobian $DC(\mathbf{X})$) is continuous on $\mathcal{X}$.
    * By the Extreme Value Theorem, the norm of the derivative is globally bounded. There must exist a finite constant $L_C$ such that:
        $$L_C = \sup_{\mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{X}} ||DC(\mathbf{X})|| < \infty$$
    * By the Mean Value Theorem (or integrating the derivative along a geodesic), this bounded derivative implies that $C(\mathbf{X})$ is Lipschitz continuous. For any $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y} \in \mathcal{X}$:
        $$||C(\mathbf{X}) - C(\mathbf{Y})||_F \le L_C \cdot d_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$$
    where $d_{\mathcal{X}}$ is any valid product metric on the state space $\mathcal{X}$. This is consistent with the report's assertion that the Lipschitz continuity of $\overline{X}_t^*$ is established in [1].
