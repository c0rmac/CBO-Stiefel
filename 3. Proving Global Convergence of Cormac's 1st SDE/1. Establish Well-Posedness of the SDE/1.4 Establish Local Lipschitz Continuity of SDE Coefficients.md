### Lemma 1.4: Local Lipschitz Continuity of SDE Coefficients
<div class="thesis-element">

**Lemma 1.4:** The coefficients of the Annealed CBO SDE system for the $i$-th particle:
$$dX_t^i = A_i(t, \mathbf{X}_t) dt + B_i(t, X_t^i) dW_t$$
where $\mathbf{X}_t = (X_t^1, \dots, X_t^N)$ and:
* **Drift:** $A_i(t, \mathbf{X}) = \lambda P_{X^i}(\overline{X}^*) - C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2}X^i$
* **Diffusion:** $B_i(t, X^i)[\cdot] = \sigma(t) P_{X^i}(\cdot)$

are (globally) Lipschitz continuous with respect to the state variables on their compact domains.

**Proof:**

1.  **Domain Compactness:** The state space for the full system is $\mathcal{X} = (V(n, k))^N$, which is compact (as established in Prop 1.2). The state space for a single particle is $V(n, k)$, which is also compact.

2.  **Continuity of the Drift Coefficient ($A_i$):**
    * Let $C(\mathbf{X}) = \overline{X}^*$ be the consensus point function. From **Lemma 1.2**, $C(\mathbf{X})$ is $C^1$ on $\mathcal{X}$.
    * Let $\Phi(Y, Z) = P_Y(Z)$ be the projection function. From **Lemma 1.3**, $\Phi(Y, Z)$ is $C^\infty$ in its arguments $Y \in V(n, k)$ and $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$.
    * Let $\pi_i: \mathcal{X} \to V(n, k)$ be the projection $\pi_i(\mathbf{X}) = X^i$. This map is $C^\infty$.
    * The first term of the drift is a composition of these $C^1$ functions:
        $$\lambda \cdot \Phi(\pi_i(\mathbf{X}), C(\mathbf{X}))$$
        A composition of $C^1$ functions is itself $C^1$.
    * The second term, $C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2}X^i$, is also $C^1$ in $\mathbf{X}$ (as $\pi_i$ is $C^\infty$).
    * The drift $A_i(t, \mathbf{X})$ is a linear combination of two $C^1$ functions. Therefore, $A_i(t, \mathbf{X})$ is a $C^1$ function on the compact manifold $\mathcal{X}$.

3.  **Continuity of the Diffusion Coefficient ($B_i$):**
    * The diffusion operator $B_i(t, X^i)[\cdot]$ is $\sigma(t) P_{X^i}(\cdot)$.
    * From **Lemma 1.3**, the map $X^i \mapsto P_{X^i}(\cdot)$ is $C^\infty$ on the compact domain $V(n, k)$.
    * The time-dependent scalar $\sigma(t)$ does not affect the differentiability with respect to $X^i$.
    * Therefore, $B_i(t, X^i)[\cdot]$ is a $C^\infty$ function on the compact manifold $V(n, k)$.

4.  **Conclusion ($C^1$ on Compact Set $\implies$ Lipschitz):**
    * As established in Lemma 1.1, any $C^1$ function on a compact domain has a bounded derivative (Jacobian) and is therefore **globally Lipschitz** continuous.
    * Since both $A_i$ (on $\mathcal{X}$) and $B_i$ (on $V(n, k)$) are $C^1$ on compact domains, they are both globally Lipschitz.
    * Global Lipschitz continuity is a stronger condition than, and thus implies, the **local Lipschitz continuity** required by standard SDE existence and uniqueness theorems.
