### Lemma 1.6: Existence of a Unique Local Solution
<div class="thesis-element">

**Lemma 1.6:** The $N$-particle SDE system
$$dX_t^i = A_i(t, \mathbf{X}_t) dt + B_i(t, X_t^i) dW_t \quad \text{for } i=1, \dots, N$$
with initial condition $\mathbf{X}_0 \in \mathcal{X} = (V(n, k))^N$, admits a unique local strong solution.

**Proof:**

1.  **Recall Classical SDE Theory:** The standard existence and uniqueness theorem for a strong solution to an SDE system requires the drift and diffusion coefficients to satisfy two conditions:
    a) **Local Lipschitz Continuity:** The coefficients are locally Lipschitz continuous in the state variable(s).
    b) **Linear Growth Condition:** The coefficients satisfy $|A(t, \mathbf{X})| + |B(t, \mathbf{X})| \le K(1 + ||\mathbf{X}||)$ for some constant $K$, ensuring the solution does not "explode" too quickly.

2.  **Verify Condition (a):** In **Lemma 1.4**, we proved that the drift coefficient $A_i(t, \mathbf{X})$ and the diffusion coefficient $B_i(t, X^i)$ are $C^1$ on the compact domains $\mathcal{X}$ and $V(n, k)$, respectively. This implies they are **globally Lipschitz** continuous on these domains, which is a stronger condition than local Lipschitz continuity. Thus, condition (a) is satisfied.

3.  **Verify Condition (b):**
    * The state space $\mathcal{X} = (V(n, k))^N$ is compact. Therefore, the norm of any state $\mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{X}$ is bounded, i.e., $||\mathbf{X}|| \le C$ for some finite constant $C$.
    * As established in **Lemma 1.4**, the coefficients $A_i$ and $B_i$ are continuous functions on the compact domain $\mathcal{X}$. By the Extreme Value Theorem, they are also bounded.
    * Any bounded function trivially satisfies the linear growth condition. If $|A(\mathbf{X})| \le M_A$ and $|B(\mathbf{X})| \le M_B$ for all $\mathbf{X}$, then:
        $$|A(\mathbf{X})| + |B(\mathbf{X})| \le M_A + M_B \le (M_A + M_B)(1 + ||\mathbf{X}||)$$
        (This holds since $1 + ||\mathbf{X}|| \ge 1$).
    * Therefore, the linear growth condition (b) is also satisfied.

4.  **Conclusion:** Since both the local Lipschitz and linear growth conditions are satisfied, the classical existence and uniqueness theorem for strong solutions to SDEs applies. This guarantees the existence of a unique local strong solution $\mathbf{X}_t$ defined up to a stopping time $\tau_e$, the explosion time.
