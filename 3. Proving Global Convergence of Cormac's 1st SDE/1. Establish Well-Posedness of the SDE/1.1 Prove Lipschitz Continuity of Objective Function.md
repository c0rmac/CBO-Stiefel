### Lemma 1.1: Lipschitz Continuity of the Objective Function
<div class="thesis-element">

**Lemma 1.1:** Let $V(n, k)$ be the Stiefel manifold, a compact Riemannian submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$. If the objective function $f: V(n, k) \to \mathbb{R}$ is $C^1$ (continuously differentiable) on the manifold, then $f$ is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the Riemannian (geodesic) distance $d(\cdot, \cdot)$.

**Proof:**

1.  **Bounded Gradient:** By assumption, the function $f$ is $C^1$. This implies its Riemannian gradient, $\nabla_{V(n,k)} f$, is a continuous vector field on $V(n, k)$. The norm of this gradient, $||\nabla_{V(n,k)} f(X)||_F$, is therefore a continuous real-valued function on $V(n, k)$.
2.  **Compact Domain:** The Stiefel manifold $V(n, k)$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, and is therefore compact.
3.  **Apply Extreme Value Theorem:** A continuous function on a compact set must attain a maximum value. Thus, the norm of the gradient is globally bounded. There exists a finite constant $L \ge 0$ such that:
    $$L = \sup_{X \in V(n, k)} ||\nabla_{V(n,k)} f(X)||_F < \infty$$
4.  **Apply Mean Value Theorem:** Let $X, Y$ be any two points in $V(n, k)$. Since $V(n, k)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold, there exists a minimizing geodesic $\gamma: [0, 1] \to V(n, k)$ such that $\gamma(0) = X$ and $\gamma(1) = Y$, with length $d(X, Y)$.
5.  By the Mean Value Theorem on manifolds (an application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus along $\gamma$):
    $$f(Y) - f(X) = \int_0^1 \langle \nabla_{V(n,k)} f(\gamma(t)), \dot{\gamma}(t) \rangle_F dt$$
    where $\dot{\gamma}(t)$ is the tangent vector to the curve at $t$.
6.  **Bound the Integral:** We take the absolute value and apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
    $$|f(Y) - f(X)| = \left| \int_0^1 \langle \nabla_{V(n,k)} f(\gamma(t)), \dot{\gamma}(t) \rangle_F dt \right|$$
    $$|f(Y) - f(X)| \le \int_0^1 ||\nabla_{V(n,k)} f(\gamma(t))||_F \cdot ||\dot{\gamma}(t)||_F dt$$
7.  Using the bound $L$ from step 3 for the gradient term:
    $$|f(Y) - f(X)| \le \int_0^1 L \cdot ||\dot{\gamma}(t)||_F dt$$
    $$|f(Y) - f(X)| \le L \int_0^1 ||\dot{\gamma}(t)||_F dt$$
8.  **Geodesic Length:** The integral $\int_0^1 ||\dot{\gamma}(t)||_F dt$ is precisely the definition of the arc length of the curve $\gamma$. Since $\gamma$ is the minimizing geodesic connecting $X$ and $Y$, its length is $d(X, Y)$.
9.  **Conclusion:** Substituting the result from step 8 into step 7, we obtain:
    $$|f(Y) - f(X)| \le L \cdot d(X, Y)$$
    This holds for all $X, Y \in V(n, k)$, which is the definition of Lipschitz continuity.
