### Lemma 1.5: Verification of the Itô Correction Term
<div class="thesis-element">

**Lemma 1.5:** Let the $i$-th particle's dynamics be given by the SDE:
$$dX_t = A_t dt + \sigma(t) P_{X_t}(dW_t)$$
where $A_t = A_t^{\text{cons}} + A_t^{\text{corr}}$ is the total drift, with:
1.  $A_t^{\text{cons}} = \lambda P_{X_t}(\overline{X}_t^*)$ (the consensus drift, which is in the tangent space $T_{X_t} V(n, k)$).
2.  $A_t^{\text{corr}} = -C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2}X_t$ (the Itô correction drift).

The particle remains on the manifold $V(n, k)$ (i.e., $X_t^\top X_t = I_k$) *if and only if* the correction drift $A_t^{\text{corr}}$ is included with $C_{n,k} = \frac{2n-k-1}{2}$.

**Proof:**

1.  **Define the Constraint:** The particle $X_t$ remains on the manifold if the constraint $g(X_t) = X_t^\top X_t - I_k = 0$ holds for all $t \ge 0$. This is equivalent to requiring that its differential $d(g(X_t))$ is zero. Since $I_k$ is constant, this means we must prove $d(X_t^\top X_t) = 0$.

2.  **Apply Itô's Product Rule:** We apply the Itô product rule to the matrix-valued process $X_t^\top X_t$. For $X_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, the $(i, j)$-th entry is $\sum_l X_{li} X_{lj}$. The Itô rule gives:
    $$d(X_t^\top X_t) = (dX_t^\top) X_t + X_t^\top (dX_t) + (dX_t^\top)(dX_t)$$
    The last term, $(dX_t^\top)(dX_t)$, is the $k \times k$ matrix of quadratic variations.

3.  **Decompose the SDE:** Let $N_t = \sigma(t) P_{X_t}(dW_t)$ be the martingale (noise) part of the SDE. So, $dX_t = A_t dt + N_t$.

4.  **Substitute into the Product Rule:**
    $$d(X_t^\top X_t) = (A_t^\top dt + N_t^\top) X_t + X_t^\top (A_t dt + N_t) + (A_t dt + N_t)^\top (A_t dt + N_t)$$
    We collect terms by $dt$ and $dW$. The $dt \cdot dt$, $dt \cdot dW$, and $dW \cdot dt$ terms are zero in the Itô limit. The $N_t^\top N_t$ term becomes its quadratic variation, which is a $dt$ term.
    $$d(X_t^\top X_t) = (A_t^\top X_t + X_t^\top A_t) dt + (N_t^\top X_t + X_t^\top N_t) + (N_t^\top N_t)$$
    The process $(N_t^\top X_t + X_t^\top N_t)$ is the new martingale part. The term $(N_t^\top N_t)$ must be interpreted as its expected value, the quadratic variation, which we will call $Q(X) dt$.
    $$Q(X) dt = \mathbb{E}[(N_t^\top N_t)] = \mathbb{E}[(\sigma(t) P_{X_t}(dW_t))^\top (\sigma(t) P_{X_t}(dW_t))]$$

5.  **Isolate the Drift:** For $d(X_t^\top X_t) = 0$, the drift (all $dt$ terms) must sum to zero:
    $$(A_t^\top X_t + X_t^\top A_t + Q(X)) dt = 0$$

6.  **Analyze the Drift Component ($A_t^\top X_t + X_t^\top A_t$):**
    We split the total drift $A_t$ into its two components:
    * **Consensus Drift ($A_t^{\text{cons}}$):** By construction, $A_t^{\text{cons}} \in T_{X_t} V(n, k)$. The definition of the tangent space is the set of matrices $A$ such that $A^\top X_t + X_t^\top A = 0$. Therefore, $(A_t^{\text{cons}})^\top X_t + X_t^\top (A_t^{\text{cons}}) = 0$. This term vanishes.
    * **Correction Drift ($A_t^{\text{corr}}$):** We compute the contribution of this term:
        $$(A_t^{\text{corr}})^\top X_t + X_t^\top (A_t^{\text{corr}}) = \left(-C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2}X_t\right)^\top X_t + X_t^\top \left(-C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2}X_t\right)$$
        $$= -C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2} (X_t^\top X_t) - C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2} (X_t^\top X_t)$$
        Since $X_t$ is on the manifold, $X_t^\top X_t = I_k$.
        $$= -C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2} I_k - C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2} I_k = -C_{n,k} \sigma(t)^2 I_k$$

7.  **Analyze the Noise Component ($Q(X)$):**
    The drift of $d(X_t^\top X_t)$ is now:
    $$\left[ 0 - C_{n,k} \sigma(t)^2 I_k + Q(X) \right] dt$$
    The report's source [1] (as cited in the text) demonstrates the calculation of the quadratic variation $Q(X)$ for the projected Wiener process. This calculation shows:
    $$Q(X) = \left( \frac{2n - k - 1}{2} \right) \sigma(t)^2 I_k$$
    (This is a non-trivial result from stochastic calculus on manifolds).

8.  **Final Cancellation:**
    The report states that the constant in the SDE is $C_{n,k} = \frac{2n - k - 1}{2}$.
    Substituting our results into the drift equation (from step 5):
    $$-C_{n,k} \sigma(t)^2 I_k + Q(X) = 0$$
    $$-\left(\frac{2n - k - 1}{2}\right) \sigma(t)^2 I_k + \left(\frac{2n - k - 1}{2}\right) \sigma(t)^2 I_k = 0$$
    The cancellation is exact.

**Conclusion:**

The constraint $d(g(X_t)) = 0$ is satisfied *if and only if* the drift of $d(X_t^\top X_t)$ is zero. This drift consists of two parts: a "spurious drift" $Q(X)$ arising from the quadratic variation of the projected noise, and the term $(A_t^\top X_t + X_t^\top A_t)$ arising from the SDE's drift.
The specific correction term $A_t^{\text{corr}} = -C_{n,k}\frac{\sigma(t)^2}{2}X_t$ is constructed *precisely* to generate a term $-C_{n,k}\sigma(t)^2 I_k$ that perfectly cancels the spurious drift $Q(X)$. Without it, the drift would be $Q(X) \ne 0$, and the particle would deterministically drift off the manifold.
