## The 6-Step Proof Architecture

1.  **Establish Well-Posedness of the SDE**
    * **Goal:** Prove that the $N$-particle SDE system has a unique, non-explosive (global) strong solution.
    * **Method:** This relies on the compactness of the Stiefel manifold $V(n, k)$ and the local Lipschitz continuity of the drift and diffusion coefficients. A key part is verifying that the Itô correction term correctly ensures the solution remains on the manifold almost surely.

2.  **Take the Mean-Field Limit**
    * **Goal:** Simplify the analysis by transitioning from the high-dimensional, stochastic $N$-particle system to its infinite-particle ($N \to \infty$) deterministic limit.
    * **Method:** We use "propagation of chaos" arguments to show the system converges to a non-linear Fokker-Planck equation (a PDE) on the manifold. This PDE can be interpreted as a Wasserstein gradient flow, which reveals an implicit convexification of the optimization problem.

3.  **Prove Irreducibility via Hypoellipticity**
    * **Goal:** Show that the algorithm can explore the *entire* search space $V(n, k)$ and is not confined to a submanifold, despite the degenerate (projected) noise.
    * **Method:** We must prove that the infinitesimal generator of the SDE is hypoelliptic. This is done by verifying **Hörmander's condition**: showing that the Lie algebra generated by the drift and diffusion vector fields spans the full tangent space $T_X V(n, k)$ at every point $X$. This confirms the stochastic controllability of the system.

4.  **Apply Large Deviation Theory**
    * **Goal:** Determine the conditions required for the system to escape any local (non-global) minimum.
    * **Method:** We apply the **Freidlin-Wentzell theory** for non-reversible systems. By analyzing the action functional and the associated quasi-potential, we can find the "cost" of transitioning between basins of attraction. This analysis dictates the necessary cooling schedule.

5.  **Derive the Critical Cooling Schedule**
    * **Goal:** Find the specific annealing rate $\sigma(t)$ that guarantees convergence.
    * **Method:** The large deviation analysis (Step 4) implies a critical logarithmic cooling schedule. We must show that convergence is guaranteed if the noise variance $\sigma(t)^2$ decreases no faster than $\sigma(t)^2 \ge C/\log(t)$, where $C$ is a constant related to the highest quasi-potential barrier.

6.  **Use Lyapunov Analysis for Final Convergence**
    * **Goal:** Synthesize the previous steps to prove that the particle distribution converges to a single point—the global minimizer $X^*$.
    * **Method:** We construct a Lyapunov functional for the Fokker-Planck equation (e.g., the variance of the particle distribution around its consensus point). We then show two things simultaneously:
        * **Consensus:** The Lyapunov analysis (with the cooling schedule) proves the variance converges to zero, meaning the particle cloud collapses to a single point ($\rho(t, \cdot) \to \delta_{x_\rho(t)}$).
        * **Optimality:** The large deviation analysis (Step 4) ensures this consensus point $x_\rho(t)$ is driven to the global minimizer $X^*$.
    * **Conclusion:** The combination of these results demonstrates that the probability density weakly converges to a Dirac delta measure at the global minimizer, $\delta_{X^*}$, which implies convergence in probability for the finite particle system.
